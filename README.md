pizza.js
========

pizza.js - a thin javascript charting library

========

Right now pizza.js supports pie charts only. It's simple. It's fast. It doesn't do much but it does it well. It will get more features in the near future, I promise.

Usage
========
* new up a pizza [ var myPizza = new pizza(); ]
* give it a crust [ myPizza.crust('a-canvas-tag'); ]
* slice it [ myPizza.slices([1,2,3,4]); ]
* deliver it to see it [ myPizza.deliver(); ]
